GetHub is something
1. git remote add origin https://github.com/JonArguijo/Final-Project.git
2. git add .
   git status to be sure it was done correctly
3. git commit -m "message to identify commit"
4. git push -u origin master

Note 
 - Only use git remote origin one time!!
 - Use git add . git commit and git push with every code change
